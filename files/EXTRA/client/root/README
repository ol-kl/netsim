benchmark.sh* 	-script to initiate TCP traffic flows, works till preconfigured 
		 time is reached. It downloads dummy files (must be in /var/www folder) 
		 onto itself, traffic follows a loop going through router/netboot server
		 and returning back on this device. Egress and ingress interfaces differ
		 naturally.
		 Script is rather short, so take a look into it to better grasp an idea what's
		 going on in there.
