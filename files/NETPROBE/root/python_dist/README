WSGI_serv_py3/		-WSGI compliant fastcgi interface implementation for Python 3.2.3 with bugfixes. To install,
                         run "setup.py install". Folder WSGI_serv_py3/flup/server/ contains diff files to reflect introduced
			 changes compared to original. This Python egg installation may install original unmodified source
			 files, therefore one should check them for correspondence to those in flup/server sub dir, otherwise
			 apply diff files provided in that dir to them (fcgi_base.py.diff, threadpool.py.diff).
distribute_setup.py 	-installation script for distutils, they allow for easy and fast installation
			 of custom PYthon modules (hete it's necessary to install WSGI-FastCGI module)

The python version 3.2.3 or 3.3.0 (in this folder)
must be compiled, built and installed on the system.
The server back-end rrd_processing.py was tested with
version 3.2.3, but should work also with 3.3.0
All the following work must be done manually:
1. Install python3.3.0 (all necessary packages 
for complining and building should be installed
during OS image building by FAI):
	tar -xf Python-archive
	cd Python-archive
	configure
	make
	make altinstall
2. Install WSGI-compliant FastCGI gateway implementation module:
	python3.3 ../distribute_setup.py
	cd ../WSGI_serv_py3
	python3.3 setup.py install

That'all, everything needed for server scipt to work is
installed and ready.

#TODO: Actually all this work should be done automatically
either by hook script during FAI OS image creation, or manually
after the Linux root FS was created but not yet compressed into
squashfs image: on this stage one just makes chroot and performs
all the above listed operations.
