fcgi_serv_cntl.sh		-wrapper to run fcgi backend and application
				 Usage: fcgi_serv_cntl.sh (start|stop|restart) 
				 Notice: fcgi gateway is launched with "www-data" user, so that
				 lighhtpd server (working under "www-data" user as well) is able
				 to read/write socket file created by fastCGI gateway.
start_tstat.sh			-simple script to start tstat in a fast way, in order to change
				 tstat properties, one should correct the script (keys and arguments
				 to tstat command) and also two following config files (if needed)
nets.conf			-instruction for tstat which nets are to be treated as internal ones
rrd.conf			-instructions for tstat which rrd DB files (what sort of measurments)
				 are to be created (they are stored in /var/www/databases, can be 
				 changed in start_tstat.sh script)
tstat-2.3			-source files (with bugfixes) of tstat. These sources must be complied
				 and installed manually for tstat to work.
				 #TODO: make this automatically. How - read README file TODO section in
				 ./python_dist
python_dist			-python3.3 source files to be compiled, WSGI module and its installation script
WSGI_serv_py3/			-WSGI compliant fastcgi interface implementation for Python 3.2.3 with bugfixes. To install,
				 run "setup.py install". Folder WSGI_serv_py3/flup/server/ contains diff files to reflect introduced 
				 changes compared to original. This Python egg installation may install original unmodified source
				 files, therefore one should check them for correspondence to those in flup/server sub dir, otherwise
				 apply diff files provided in that dir to them (fcgi_base.py.diff, threadpool.py.diff).
